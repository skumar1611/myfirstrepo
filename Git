Git - It is a tool distributed verson control tool or Source code management tool
  In this control tool we have two terms: Git and github
  
  Git is for your local repo sitory (created on your local system) and Github is your remote Repository .
  
  Repository : It is a place where you can store your source code.
  
  Some useful terms:
  
  Working directory : Directory on your local system/server where you write the code.
  
  Commit : where there is any change in the source code then every time new commit ID will generate and it contains 40 alpha-numeric value.
  
  Installtion of git on ubuntu:
  
  #apt update -y
  #apt install git -y
  # git --version  (Tocheck the git version)
  # which git  (to check git is installed or not, this command will show you the binary)
 Now userconfiguration :
 
 #git --config --global user.name "sumit"
 #git --config --global user.email "sumit.kumar@kellton.com" 
 # git config --list (to check the user)
 # git config --global --edit (to edit the user details)
 
 Now create EC2 machine in AWS cloud:
 Note: enable ssh and http is SG of EC2 server
 
 Access it through CLI
 Now create a directory in the server
 # mkdir mygit
 
 Go inside the above directory and then 
 
 #git init (this command will change the directory into repo)
 Note : lyou will get a hidden folder with name .git in pwd
 
 Now create a soucre file (.yaml,java,text....etc)
# git add .  (it will add this code into staging area)

#git status (to check current status)
# git commit -m "type any message"

After commit this will go under local repo

# git status
#git log
#git show  "commit ID"  (to see the details)
#git remote add origin "central git url" >>>>>create account on github and create a repository on github
#git push -u origin master  (use git account creds)
===========================================================================
Command to check branch

# git branch  
above command will show you the braches and * represent working brach (means you are inside the branch having star sign)

#git branch  newbranchname    >>>>>> to create new branch
# git branch  (show you all available branch)
 # git checkout  branchname (inwhich you want to go inside)
==========================================================================

Command to merge the branch into master 
Go inside the master branch using checkout command
#git checkout master
then  run
#git merge branchname    >>>>>>branchname is branch you want to merge in master
# get branch

Note:  when ever you create a new branch from master and you did any change after that you need to add it in staging area and then commit it before merge into master

Once you merge the branch then you can push it on github
#git push origin master  >>>>>> enter the username and password
